# Personal Page

Welcome to my personal GitHub Page repository! This page was built using the Astro Framework in JavaScript, styled with Tailwind CSS, and powered by Node.js 20 LTS. It is hosted on GitHub Pages. Feel free to explore the source code and learn more about me, my projects, and my interests.

## Technologies Used

- **Astro Framework**: A modern static site generator for JavaScript developers. It combines the best parts of modern build tools with performance-driven development and a minimal, expressive API.

- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework that makes it easy to design and build modern, responsive websites. It's highly customizable and easy to use, allowing for rapid development.

- **Node.js 20 LTS**: The JavaScript runtime that powers the server-side of the application. The LTS (Long Term Support) version ensures stability and security for the project.
